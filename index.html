			# The Problem(s)
			
			1. Does it scale?
			2. Is it portable? - Write once run anywhere
			3. How do I deploy?
			4. How do I monitor my app?
			5. Where are my logs?
			6. Is my app performing well?

			# Kubernetes
			or k8s (`k` eight letters then `s`)
			* "Kubernetes" is Greek for governor, helmsman, captain.
			* Open-Source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications
			* Nautical themed ecosystem
				* `Raft` - networking
				* `Helm` - template engine on top of k8s (yo dawg I heard you like yaml)
				* `Harbor` - container registry
				* `Rudr` - A Kubernetes implementation of the Open Application Model
			---
			# K8s System Architecture

			--
			* Master nodes (prod *_requires_* a quorum)
				* `kubelet`
				* `kube-apiserver`
				* `kube-proxy`
				* `kube-controller-manager`
				* `etcd`
				* `cloud-controller-manager`
				* other abstraction tools
				* probably *not* your app
			
			--
			* Worker nodes (scales up to whatever you need)
				* `kubelet`
				* `kube-proxy`
				* other logging and monitoring tools

			--
				* .red[**your app!**]
			---
			# `kubectl`
			* "kubernetes control" (can be pronounced _kube cuddle_ or _kube c t l_)
			* common actions
				* `get`
				* `apply`
				* `exec`
				* `port-forward`
				* `describe`
			---
			# Objects
			* Managed by `kube-apiserver`
			* State stored in `etcd`
			* expressed in YAML or JSON (but mostly YAML)
			* required fields
				* `apiVersion` - _generally_ backwards compatible but don't count on it
				* `kind` - deployments, pod disruption budget, horizontal pod autoscaler
				* `metadata` - name, labels, annotations, etc
				* `spec` - the object you wish to manage
			---
			# Namespace
			* Nearly every object belongs to a namespace
			* Useful for logical separation of applications
				* Use one k8s cluster for many non-prod environments
			* Separate workloads
				* Generally you will want to separate your app from k8s pods
				* Monitoring and Management tools should run in their own namespace
			
			---
			# Pods - the atom of k8s
			* one or more containers
			* containers _always_ collocated
			* containers in the pod share
				* disk (ephemeral unless otherwise configured)
				* IP
				* Hostname
			* CPU/Memory resource requests and limits
				* **CRITICAL** to application stability and autoscaling
				* Request - resource allocated exclusively to that pod
				* Limit - maximum amount of the resource that can be consumed

			---
			# Example `pod`
			```yaml
			apiVersion: v1
			kind: Pod
			metadata:
			  name: hello-world
			  labels:
			    app: hello-world
			    version: 4.0.4
			spec:
			  containers:
			    - name: hello-world
			      image: busybox
			      resources:
			        requests:
			          cpu: '100m'
			        limits:
			          cpu: '1000m'
			      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello World && sleep 60']
			    - name: hello-hostname
			      image: busybox
			      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello World! I am $HOSTNAME && sleep 60']

			```
			---
			# Controllers
			how we deploy and scale
			* contains a template spec of the pod you wish to run
			* dictates how to scale your pods
			---
			# `StatefulSet` 
			* Fixed IP
			* Fixed hostname
			* Stays on the same host
			* Ordered scaling and updates
			* Good for stateful applications like databases, message queues, file servers, etc
			* Examples:
				* PostgreSQL
				* RabbitMQ
				* Redis
				* Kafka
				* NFS
				* Poorly architected app that you've been asked to deploy
			---
			# `DaemonSet`
			* Runs on every node in the cluster 
			* Good for cluster-wide services like logging, monitoring, etc
			* Examples:
				* cadvisor - tool for monitoring host and container metrics
				* fluentd - tool for capturing logs from containers (`stdout` remember the 12 factor app!)

			---
			# `Deployment`
			* Built on `ReplicaSets`
			* Desired State
			* Scale
			* Perfect for [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/)
			* Deployments
				* Rolling
				* Blue/Green
				* A/B
				* Canary
				* Recreate
			---
			# Example `Deployment`
			```yaml
				apiVersion: apps/v1
				kind: Deployment
				metadata:
					name: nginx-deployment
					labels:
						app: nginx
				spec:
				  replicas: 3
				  selector:
				    matchLabels:
				      app: nginx
				  template:
				    metadata:
				      labels:
				        app: nginx
				    spec:
				      containers:
				      - name: nginx
				        image: nginx:1.7.9
				        ports:
				        - containerPort: 80
				```
			---
			# `Services`
			* Persistent route to one or more pods
			* Usually uses a `Selector` to match the backend pod(s)
			* Service discovery
				* DNS
				* Environment vars
				* API
			* `ServiceTypes`
				* `ClusterIP` - Expose your service to internal cluster resources only
				* `NodePort` - Expose your service on every node in the cluster
				* `LoadBalancer` - Expose your service outside your cluster
				* `ExternalName` - external resources

			```yaml
			apiVersion: v1
			kind: Service
			metadata:
			  name: nginx-svc
			spec:
			  selector:
			    app: nginx
			  ports:
			    - protocol: TCP
			      port: 80
			      targetPort: 9376
			```
			---
			# `Ingress`
			* Proxies traffic from outside the cluster to internal `ClusterIP` services
			* Backed by an `IngressController` (usually nginx, haproxy, some other l7 proxy)
			* SSL termination
			* Virtual Hosting - vhosts (apache) servers (nginx)
			```
			foo.bar.com --|                 |-> foo.bar.com service1:80
			                  | 178.91.123.132  |
			bar.foo.com --|                 |-> bar.foo.com service2:80
			```
			* Fanout
			```
			foo.bar.com -> 178.91.123.132 -> / foo    service1:4200
			  	                               / bar    service2:8080
			```
			---
			# K8s in _the Cloud_
			* Infrastructure agnostic .red[*]
				* Bare Metal
				* VM Cluster (vSphere, HyperV, KVM, etc)
				* IaaS Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc)

			.footnote[.bottom.red[\* sorta]]

			--
			* Distros
				* OpenShift
				* Rancher
				* Canonical

			--
			* K8saaS (Kubernetes as a Service)
				* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5 would recommend
				* Offered by the major cloud providers
				* Master nodes are managed by the provider
				* _Usually_ you only pay for worker nodes
				* Updates are automated
				* Management tooling provided


			---
			# Monitoring and Reliability
			* New "Cloud Native" open-source monitoring and metrics tools
				* Heapster - original k8s metrics collector
				* Prometheus - correct k8s metrics collector
			* Prometheus metrics format "standard"
				* Libraries exist for most languages and frameworks
				* Libraries often auto-instrument your app
				* Libraries often don't auto-instrument your app in the way you want
			---
			# Reliability: Healthchecks
			* They will save you

			--
			* They will burn you

			--
			* Attribute of a container
			* Types
				* liveness - is the pod alive
				* readiness - is the pod ready to do work
			* Check options
				* `tcpSocket`
				* `command`
				* `httpGet`

			---
			# Example Healthchecks
			```yaml
			livenessProbe:
			  httpGet:
			    path: /health
			    port: 8080
			  failureThreshold: 1
			  periodSeconds: 10
			readinessProbe:
			  exec:
			    command:
			    - cat
			    - /tmp/healthy
			  initialDelaySeconds: 5
			  periodSeconds: 10
			```

			---
			# Lab
			#### Objective: Deploy a web app to your k8s cluster
			* Install an [ingress controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html)
			* Things you'll need to write
				* `deployment` spec for your app
				* `service` spec
				* `ingress` spec (nip.io is great for testing without waiting for DNS to replicate)
				* CI Integration
			* Bonus points
				* `service` spec for your database
				* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
